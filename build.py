Build all parts to output/.

Printed parts (cup, baffle, fork-yoke, slider) export as both STL (ready to
print) and STEP (clean B-rep). The BOW is a REFERENCE body (bought Beyer part /
DIY blank) — STEP only, never in the printed-STL set. One failing part won't stop
the others; you get a per-part status so you can iterate on just one part.

Side effects beyond output/:
  - renders/   headless front/iso/side PNGs per printed part (render.py). Needs
               matplotlib (requirements-dev.txt); SKIPPED cleanly if absent, so a
               forker with only the core deps still builds parts.
  - docs/models/first-chair.glb   the assembly as a web-viewable GLB for the
               Pages build page (model-viewer). An intentional published artifact.

Usage:
    python build.py            # build everything
    python build.py cup baffle # build only named parts
