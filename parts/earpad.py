Earpad — a generalised round cushion MOCKUP (reference only, NOT printed).

First Chair doesn't ship an earpad: builders fit their own round pad from the
broad Beyerdynamic range or aftermarket makers (Brainwavz, Dekoni, …). This module
models a representative round cushion so the assembly and the website views read
like a finished headphone, and so the cup's pad-grip OD / lip have something to seat.

Modelled as a torus cushion with a flat mounting base (a puffy ring with an ear
opening) — built from the makeTorus PRIMITIVE, not a revolve (revolve is unusable on
this OCC build). Local frame: the flat mounting base is at z=0 (seats on the cup
front rim); the cushion rises +Z toward the head, the ear opening down the centre.
All dimensions are a generic ESTIMATE (params.py) — measure/refine for a real pad.
