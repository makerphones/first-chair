Hardware bill of materials — emitted by build.py to BOM.md.

This is part of the open product, same as the DESIGN-LOG: it's what a forker needs
to actually source the build. Quantities are DERIVED FROM params.py counts × 2
ears, so they track the design automatically (change baffle_screw_count or
pivot_boss_count and the BOM follows).

PART NUMBERS were researched against live supplier catalogs (2026-06-27) and each
is tagged with how confident we are. Per the project's accuracy rule we NEVER
invent a part number, supplier, or price — every catalog number below was read on
a real supplier page. Flags:

  VERIFIED — part # + spec read straight off the cited supplier page (price may
             still drift; confirm at cart). The default for the fasteners.
  REF      — a confirmed reference for a specific bought part (the Beyer bow).
  SPEC     — the SPEC is pinned, but the exact SKU is builder's choice / the
             small-qty source varies (commodity washers, cable) — verify live.
  MAKER    — maker-supplied; the maker already has these (Kingstate driver, Beyer
             pads). No SKU pinned by design.
  ESTIMATE — a working price/selection pending confirmation.

Source URLs live next to each part so a builder can click through. The ESTIMATE
rows are starting points, not quotes — verify against the live page when you source.
